# Machine Learning - Regression

Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there. It allows us to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of our data and some *observed, continuous-valued response*. Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks.

To begin, we recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. Review the material we’ll cover each week, and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course. These assignments---one per Module 2 through 7--- will give you hands-on experience in fundamental regression concepts, including implementing and applying regression algorithms to real-world data. In particular, the topics covered include:
Simple linear regression
Multiple regression
Assessing performance
Ridge regression
Feature selection & Lasso
Nearest neighbor & kernel regression

You will also become familiar with and implement fundamental techniques that are core to all of machine learning, beyond regression, such as cross validation, bias-variance tradeoff, gradient descent and coordinate descent.
