# Machine Learning - Regression

Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there. It allows us to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of our data and some **observed, continuous-valued response**. Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks.

The topics covered include:
- Simple linear regression
- Multiple regression
- Assessing performance
- Ridge regression
- Feature selection & Lasso
- Nearest neighbor & kernel regression

also some fundamental techniques that are core to all of machine learning, beyond regression, such as:
- Cross validation
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Gradient descent
- Coordinate descent.
